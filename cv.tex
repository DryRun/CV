\years{2019--present} \textbf{Jet substructure tagging}: developed a mass-decorrelation technique for machine learning-based jet substructure taggers using biased Monte Carlo samples with uniform mass distributions. The samples are used to train robust jet taggers and jet mass regression algorithms based on graph neural networks, together with additional decorrelation techniques like adversarial training or contrastive learning. 

\years{2019--23} \textbf{b hadron production fractions}: measurement of b~hadron production fraction ratios using the CMS ``B parking'' data set, reducing a leading systematic uncertainty for the $\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{s}}\rightarrow\mu\mu$ branching fraction measurement.
